# Power Grid Load Analysis – Markov Chain Tool

## Overview

This project is a web-based tool to model power grid load behavior using a 3‑state Markov chain. It helps you:

- Define a 3×3 transition matrix between three load states (e.g., Low / Normal / Overload)  
- Set an initial load distribution  
- Assign real-world MW values to each state  
- Simulate day‑by‑day probabilities, steady‑state behavior, overload risk, and expected load on the last day  

The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and the plots use Chart.js. Everything runs fully in the browser.
